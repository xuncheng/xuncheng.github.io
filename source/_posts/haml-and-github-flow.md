### GitHub Flow [http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of `master` (ie: `new-oauth2-scopes`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/)
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master
- Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and *should* deploy immediately

### Three Git resources
- One of the best git introduction videos that talks about "what's behind the scenes":

- One of our students wrote down the details of how to do the Github Flow process:

- Lastly, the video Kevin made that talks about an alternative git flow (not the Github Flow process that we use in this course).
